  safe integer and the largest representable number of single-precision floating-point numbers are 2<sup>24</sup>-1 and 
  2<sup>128</sup>. Using single-precision floating-point numbers will also result in situations like 
  2<sup>24</sup>+1=2<sup>24</sup>. However, there are two other ways to represent integers: int and long. int (unsigned) 
  can represent numbers as large as 4294967295 (2<sup>32</sup>-1), while long (unsigned) can represent numbers as large
   as 18446744073709551616 (2<sup>64</sup>-1). These two types have no error, but the disadvantage is that the numbers
    they can represent are also very small. However, some games have exceeded the upper limit of 1e308: Antimatter 
    Dimensions, Incremental Mass Rewritten...<del>etc.</del>. But the upper limits of the numbers represented by these

    1.000e9.007e15); the theorical upper limit of the Incremental Mass Rewritten is F1.797e308(10^^1.797e308); the largest,

“这是什么资源？”“我闻所未闻！”其他人这样评论。这真是一个伟大的发现！在开辟了这条道路后，众多玩家纷纷跟随。
这件事很快被Teresa知晓。Teresa思索，认为玩家们对天神绝不会产生任何威胁，于是向他们开放了自己的现实。
Teresa的现实在公开开放后的1/1e300秒内立刻崩溃了。(Error: Server Offline.)
